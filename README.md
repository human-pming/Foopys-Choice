## Overview

In this project, we created a voice-enabled Android app that recommends the food recipes for users.<br/>
There are the key points we build.

*   Design the user interaction
*   Create and train a Wit app to do natural language processing (NLP) to catogorize weather
*   Integrate Wit with Android app
*   Randomly recommend recipes based on weather

Tell Foopy about today's weather. Foopy will recommend today's food right away! <br/>If you are dissatisfied, ask Foopy again and get new recommendations üëç<br/>

## Conversation Design

This is the short scenario users can communicate with Foopy.

Let's consider the following conversation as the happy path:
```
Foopy: "Hello! I am Foopy taking care of your happy diet.
      I will recommend a suitable diet according to the weather. How‚Äôs the weather outside?"

User: "It‚Äôs a bit blowy day."

Foopy: "Let's see some good recipes to eat in this weather. Press show button."
```

Now let's think about scenarios were the user can deviate:
```
Foopy: "Hello! I am Foopy taking care of your happy diet.
      I will recommend a suitable diet according to the weather. How‚Äôs the weather outside?"

User: "I'm so hungry"

Foopy: "I'm sorry. Please say it again."

User: "The sky looks stormy."

Foopy: "Let's see some good recipes to eat in this weather. Press show button."
```
